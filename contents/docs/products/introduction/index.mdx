###  1.1 Background
Coopbank possesses a diverse range of products within its portfolio. These products are 
dispersed among different banking organs, which makes it challenging for employees of the 
bank to find them in one place for clear understanding to serve clients effectively. Therefore, 
this product catalog is destined to streamline sales efforts while simultaneously serving as an 
informative resource for employees.
 ### 1.2 Objective 
 The objective of this document is to develop an organized product catalog that the 
bank's employees can use as a reference when they need information about the products 
and services of the bank.
### 1.3 Methodology
 Secondary data collection methods were used to prepare the document. The majority of 
the information for crafting this content were collected from the procedures related to 
customer account opening and credit operations. Furthermore, the bank's website was also refered for cross-verification purposes.
